#+title: Advent of code 2023
#+author: Luca Zaninotto -- 2057074
#+date: \today
* Structure
  Each day has its own folder, all contined in ~src~:
  #+begin_src fundamental
    src/
    ├── d1
    ├── d2
    ├── d3
    └── ...
  #+end_src
  each day might use a different language, but I'll try to do
  everything in either =rust= or =lisp=.
** Rust projects
   Can be simply run with
   #+begin_src sh
     cargo run
   #+end_src
** Lisp projects
   Can be run by using any common lisp interpreter (e.g., =sbcl=)
   #+begin_src sh
     sbcl main.lisp
   #+end_src
** Special cases
   Will describe how to be handled in their specific folder
